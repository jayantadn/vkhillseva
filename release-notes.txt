Hare Krishna dear devotees, 

All glories to Srila Prabhupada.

This is for your kind information that, starting this weekend, the Nitya Seva ticket amounts are changed. Garuda app has been updated to incorporate the changes. 

Please use the following URL to access the Garuda app, there are no changes in URL. Check for version 5.0.2 or above on the home page. Kindly refresh the page until you see this version.

https://vkhillgaruda.web.app/

Additionally, access control is enabled based on mobile number. If anyone faces issues with "Access Denied", please send me the mobile number you are registered with. Access check may need up to 2 secs extra. Please consider the delay in Nitya Seva app launch as normal.

Requesting everyone to log in to the new URL and try to create tickets with the new denominations. There is a test session created, kindly use that to enter tickets during trials. The test session will be deleted by Friday eod. Please try from home already, to avoid any service interruptions in the temple.
For any issues Kindly contact me directly or reply to this post.

Ys,
Jayanta
