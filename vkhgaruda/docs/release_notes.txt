Hare Krishna prabhus, 

Temple authorities have informed us that, for Nitya Seva new receipt books will be issued from this weekend. The following changes will be implemented:
- Seva amount 400 will be changed to 500
- Seva amount 500 will be changed to 600
- no changes in 1000 and 2500 tickets
- tickets of 400 will no longer be available.

Garuda app is updated to reflect the above changes. Kindly visit the following link for testing. Please note that the below link is only for testing. You play around the data as you wish. After successful testing, the same will deployed to the production link.

Please check for the version 4.1.0 or above in the home page. Refresh the page until new version is visible.

Please help out with the following validations:
1. old data is visible without any issues (include amount 400)
2. New seva amounts are reflected properly

Other than the seva amount changes, there are also some cosmetic changes done. I believe they are very self explanatory.

For any issues Kindly contact me directly or reply to this post.

We would like to receive the feedback by tomorrow noon, so that any fixes I can plan in the afternoon. Sorry for the short notice.

Ys,
Jayanta
